Representing the Basic Attention Token ($BAT) community—a group of dedicated and trustworthy individuals—we aim to amplify the principled perspectives of our delegates and independent leaders while advocating for the Cardano network. We strive to uphold robust representation for the BAT community and support the network’s growth in alignment with its core values.",
